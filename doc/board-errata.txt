PCB / Hardware Errata
=====================
v1.0:
	Pin 6 (RA7) of U3 is utilised as the infrared receiver's data line, backed
	by a UART RX in the firmware.  However, the PPS module of the PIC16F15355
	does not allow UART functions to be mapped to PORTA pins.  A bodge wire
	is required from pin 6 (RA7) to pin 18 (RB0) to allow mapping.  This
	bodge wire is accomplished by dedicating a CLC module in the firmware,
	thus no soldering is required.

	Pin 18 (RB0) is no longer available for the DEBUG0 functions as it has
	been repurposed as the infrared receiver's data line (UART RX from RA7).

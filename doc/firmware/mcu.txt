Module and Resource Allocation
==============================
rgb-leds:
	UART1 is used for serial transmission; SPI would be better as it is the
	native SM16703P / WS2812B protocol (MSb-first as opposed to UART's
	LSb-first) but because of a lack of double-buffering the timing constraints
	are unrealistic.

	TIMER2 is the timebase for the UART bit modulators.

	PWM3 is used for a long on-time bit (1).

	PWM4 is used for a short on-time bit (0).

	CLC1, 3 and 4 are used to modulate the UART1 DT pin by steering either the
	long on-time (PWM3) or short on-time (PWM4) to CLC1OUT.

	FSR1 is allocated to a circular buffer for UART1's TX1REG bytes.  There
	can be no gap in between byte transmission as the LEDs expect a constant
	baud of 800kHz without a clock.

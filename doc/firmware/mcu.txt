Module and Resource Allocation
==============================
rgb-leds:
	TIMER0 is used for frame synchronisation.

	UART1 is used for serial transmission; SPI would be better as it is the
	native SM16703P / WS2812B protocol (MSb-first as opposed to UART's
	LSb-first) but because of a lack of double-buffering the timing constraints
	are unrealistic.

	TIMER2 is the timebase for the UART bit modulators.

	PWM3 is used for a long on-time bit (1).

	PWM4 is used for a short on-time bit (0).

	CLC1 and CLC4 are used to modulate the UART1 DT pin by steering either the
	long on-time (PWM3) or short on-time (PWM4) to CLC1OUT.

	FSR1 is allocated to a circular buffer for UART1's TX1REG bytes.  There
	can be no gap in between byte transmission as the LEDs expect a constant
	baud of 800kHz without a clock.

ir-transceiver:
	UART2 is used for (asynchronous) serial transmission and reception with
	the external infrared LED and receiver.

	TIMER1 is the timebase for the carrier wave used by the transmitter; an
	80kHz toggle gives a 40kHz square-wave carrier.

	CLC2 is used to modulate the TIMER1 carrier with the UART2 TX pin.

	CLC3 is used as a bodge wire for v1.0 of the board to avoid soldering a
	physical bodge wire from RA7 to RB0.  This is necessary because PPS does
	not allow mapping of the UART functions to PORTA.

power-monitor:
	ADC1 is used to sample the +12V input rail; a minimum of 7.5ksps is
	required to prevent aliasing.  Full-scale 5V represents 20V input which
	is higher than the absolute maximum rating for the DML3006LFDS power
	switch.  Conversion clock source is Fosc/64 to give the maximum Tad=2us
	(better ADC performance is achieved with larger Tad).

	FVR1 is set to 4.096V for ADC1.

	NCO1 is used as the auto-conversion trigger for ADC1.

	The reset line from the SR flip-flop (CLC4) used by the rgb-leds module
	is manipulated to disable the serial transmission while the power rail
	is disabled.
